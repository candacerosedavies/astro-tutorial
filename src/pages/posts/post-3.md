<!-- REFACTORED TITLE: MarkdownPostLayout.astro has the following in html section. Don't need anything in the JS section, eg const { title } = Astro.props;
<h1>{frontmatter.title}</h1> -->
<!-- # My Third Blog Post -->

It wasn't always smooth sailing, but I'm enjoying building with Astro. And, the [Discord community](https://astro.build/chat) is really friendly and helpful!
